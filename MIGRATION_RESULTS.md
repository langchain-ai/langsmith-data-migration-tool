# Migration Summary

## Successfully Created Run Rules with Evaluators:
- Correctness (multiple datasets)
- Hallucination
- Conciseness  
- Get Next Due Date
- Retrieval Correctness
- Plan Checker

## Key Points:
- 11 run rules successfully created with evaluators attached to datasets
- Evaluators are now properly tied to their datasets through run rules
- Rules with only session_ids (no dataset_ids) were skipped as sessions don't exist in target environment
- This is expected behavior when migrating between different LangSmith instances

## Next Steps:
1. Verify the created run rules in LangSmith UI
2. Test evaluations on the migrated datasets
3. Create annotation queues manually in UI (1 queue referenced)
4. Configure alerts if needed
